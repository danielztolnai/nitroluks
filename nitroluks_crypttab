# This is an example crypttab file for nitrolux
# Simply add the 'keyscript=/usr/bin/nitroluks-keyscript' to your luks entry and you are good to go
# If your Nitrokey slot name is not 'LUKS', pass the slot name as the third parameter (keyfile)
# Below is an example how the entry might look

<device> UUID=<DISK-UUID> <SLOT-NAME> luks keyscript=/usr/bin/nitroluks-keyscript
